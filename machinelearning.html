            <p>Medium has a list of the people they consider their top writers. These lists are tracked by topic. I’ve
                been on their official top writers' list for AI, Technology, Business, and Education for a while.
                Yesterday, I cracked their top 5 writers for AI. I’m also ranked number 6 when it comes to articles on
                Technology and number 10 for education. My content has seen explosive growth over the last 2–3 months,
                and a large part has been all of you. All the feedback you’ve shared has helped me improve my
                content.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/machinelearning-1.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            <p>To celebrate this, I have a special post for you. I’m going to talk about the approach that I used to
                master difficult Machine Learning ideas and concepts on my own, without a Master’s Degree or without
                paying for expensive boot camps/courses. I did it using the free resources available on the internet.
                Even if you’re someone who hates ML with every fiber of their being, read on. This system for learning
                things will be useful to you to master your chosen domain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>And no I’m not going to tell you to go Kaggle/or do some generic personal projects. I have something that
                will help you build a much more comprehensive insight into the topics behind Machine Learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you ready to get into it? This is an approach that a lot of the people that have reached out to me
                for mentorship have benefitted from.

                <li>
                    <p><b>The current standard advice for beginners in ML-</b>
                    When it comes to telling beginners in ML how they should learn ML, the standard advice is to do a
                        project. Often accompanied by a list of standard projects that every wannabe ML person has on
                        their resume. Some even throw the ‘do a course’.</p>
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Why this advice is bad-</b>
                    Projects and courses can be great because of the structure they provide. However, relying on them
                        exclusively will turn this strength into a weakness. Projects will teach you how to do things.
                        They will not teach you what to do. Many times, tutorials and courses do a lot of the legwork
                        for you. Thus you will not be equipped for the messiness of real-world challenges.</p>
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    <p> <b>What you should do instead-</b>
                    Read. Yes, I say this a lot. It’s because this works. Specifically, start reading actual Machine
                        Learning Research papers. Yes, even if you’re a beginner who knows very little. I’ll go over an
                        overview of what to do in this article. A more in-depth piece on how to interact with very
                        technical documents/talks will be covered on another Saturday.</p>
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    <p><b>For best results-</b>
                    Once you come across ideas, now is when you can try mini-projects for learning how to actually
                        implement these ideas. This will expose you to the coding and the various frameworks available
                        to you. Best of both worlds.</p>
