        <p>
          Once upon a time, in a world not too different from ours, handmade
          clothing was the norm.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But as technology advanced, machines were invented that could produce
          clothing at a much faster rate and at a fraction of the cost.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At first, many people were skeptical of the new machine-made clothing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, as time passed, more and more people began to embrace the new
          technology, seeing the benefits of faster production and lower prices.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The artisans who had once made a living crafting handmade garments
          found themselves struggling to compete with the new machine-made
          clothing.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Some feared that the art of handmade garments would be lost forever
          and that the new clothing would lack the quality and beauty of the
          handmade. Many were forced to adapt and learn the new technology,
          while others were left behind. Gradually, handmade clothing became a
          rarity, and the vast majority of clothing that you see today is
          produced by machines — not humans.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          History is repeating itself. But this time it is for the people in the
          tech world. AI-powered tools are here to replace human coders.

        <p>
          Initially most corporate software was written in machine code.
          Somebody had to invent the higher-level languages (that were good for
          a few years). Unfortunately — We’re still using them, ones basically
          from the 60s, reinventing it over and over again.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          AI-powered tools are ready to take over, and traditional ways of
          writing code will become less popular. The future may be far different
          than you have ever imagined. The tech industry is shifting, and the
          race is on to adapt or be left behind. You don’t have to believe me —
          all you have to do is to take a glance in the reality and you will
          know what I mean.

          ChatGPT only took a few seconds to identify the bug. I don’t know
          about you, but most people would have taken much longer.
