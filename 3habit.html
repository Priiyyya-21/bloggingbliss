            <p>Starting off a new year with a good feeling is something so many of us want. This is why New Year’s
                resolutions are so popular.</p>
            <br>
            <p>New year, new chances, right? But being motivated at the start only to quit midway is also quite common.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It happens to many of us:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Trying to lose weight, but you end up eating more and exercising less;</li> <br>
                <li>Trying to write a book, but distractions keep on social media all day</li> <br>
                <li>Wanting to earn more, but you’re stuck at your current job</li> <br>
                <li>Wanting to stop procrastination, but you can’t take action</li><br>
                <li>And so forth.</li> <br>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                To overcome that, we need self-discipline. With discipline, you can be more consistent, avoid
                distractions, and keep your emotions from interfering with your career and investment decisions. </p>
            <br>

            <p> But being more disciplined is easier said than done. There are two crucial things to discipline: First
                is doing less. When you do less, your efforts and energy are more concentrated and better spent. So you
                don’t run out of motivation very quickly.</p> <br>

            <p>Second is reducing friction.</p> <br>

            <p>I once became a member of a well–equipped gym, complete with a sauna and everything. It was a nice
                place. But it was a twenty-minute drive, and it wasn’t even along my way to the office. The result? I
                probably only went a dozen times in a year. </p> <br>

            <p>After that, I went to a gym that was on the way to my office. I had no excuse. Going to the gym was so
                easy I just went almost every day.</p> <br>

            <p>Once you have both factors, becoming disciplined becomes much easier. You get the idea. We don’t need to
                spend more time on that topic.</p> <br>

            <p>It’s much more important to quit the bad habits you might have. The habits that are destroying your
                self-discipline.</p> <br>

            <p>These are the 3 habits you can quit to achieve your 2023 goals.</p> <br>
