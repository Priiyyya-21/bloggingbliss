                    <p>In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert
                        information—such as a
                        letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
                        communication
                        through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an invention
                        of
                        language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard,
                        or felt to
                        others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and
                        limits the
                        audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted
                        spoken
                        language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.</p>

                    <p>
                        In information theory and computer science, a code is usually considered as an algorithm that
                        uniquely
                        represents symbols from some source alphabet, by encoded strings, which may be in some other
                        target
                        alphabet. An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source
                        alphabet is
                        obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.
                    <p>is a code, whose source alphabet is the set Using the extension of the code, the encoded string
                        0011001 can be grouped into codewords as
                        and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols acab.</p>

                    <h3 class="font2">Variable-length codes</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In this section, we consider codes that encode each source (clear text) character by a code word
                        from some dictionary, and concatenation of such code words give us an encoded string.
                        Variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different
                        probabilities; see also entropy encoding.<br>
                        A prefix code is a code with the "prefix property": there is no valid code word in the system
                        that is a prefix (start) of any other valid code word in the set. Huffman coding is the most
                        known algorithm for deriving prefix codes. Prefix codes are widely referred to as "Huffman
                        codes" even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm. Other examples of prefix
                        codes are country calling codes, the country and publisher parts of ISBNs, and the Secondary
                        Synchronization Codes used in the UMTS WCDMA 3G Wireless Standard.

                        Kraft's inequality characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix
                        code. Virtually any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessarily a prefix one, must
                        satisfy Kraft's inequality. </p><br>
                    <h3 class="font2">Error-correcting codes</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Codes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or
                        storage. This so-called error-correcting code works by including carefully crafted redundancy
                        with the stored (or transmitted) data. Examples include Hamming codes, Reed–Solomon,
                        Reed–Muller, Walsh–Hadamard, Bose–Chaudhuri–Hochquenghem, Turbo, Golay, Goppa, low-density
                        parity-check codes, and space–time codes. Error detecting codes can be optimised to detect burst
                        errors, or random errors.</p>

                <h3 class="font2">Example</h3>
                <div class=" max-width-1  m-auto my-2">
                    <hr>
                </div>

                    <p>A cable code replaces words (e.g. ship or invoice) with shorter words, allowing the same
                        information to be sent with fewer characters, more quickly, and less expensively.

                        Codes can be used for brevity. When telegraph messages were the state of the art in rapid
                        long-distance communication, elaborate systems of commercial codes that encoded complete phrases
                        into single mouths (commonly five-minute groups) were developed, so that telegraphers became
                        conversant with such "words" as BYOXO ("Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?"), LIOUY ("Why
                        do you not answer my question?"), BMULD ("You're a skunk!"), or AYYLU ("Not clearly coded,
                        repeat more clearly."). Code words were chosen for various reasons: length, pronounceability,
                        etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for
                        military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for
                        espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front
                        for the American Black Chamber run by Herbert Yardley between the First and Second World Wars.
                        The purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for data
                        compression predates the computer era; an early example is the telegraph Morse code where
                        more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as Huffman coding
                        are now used by computer-based algorithms to compress large data files into a more compact form
                        for storage or transmission.</p>
